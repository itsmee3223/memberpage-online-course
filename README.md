## üßæ Description
<p align='justify'>
Microservice is one of the architectures on Website Development that is used by many Developers and IT companies in developing a Website. The goal is for the Website to be more stable and easy to fix in each of its services if there is a bug in the service. The project built is a website for online learning (digital class) for anyone who wants to upgrade skills in the world of IT or also self-improvement. Starting from slicing the website design from Figma using the React JavaScript Framework and also assisted with Tailwind CSS. After that we will try using the API (per service) that we have created using Laravel and Express JS.
